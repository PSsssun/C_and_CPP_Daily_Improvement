# learn_c_and_cpp
Learn c and cpp language. I provide some random exercises when I am learning the cpp.  


## Resources
1. reference: https://en.cppreference.com/
2. tutorial: https://www.learncpp.com/
3. Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs: https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html (should take a look at this book whatever language you are learning)
4. Stanford CS 106L lectures: http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs106l/lectures.html 

## Tricks and Skills
1. firstly, we do the gcc test.cpp then ./a.out but we can add ./a.out > out.txt to save in a txt file and we can add ./a.out < input.txt to add an input file
2. sometimes I prefer to use the linux system, so i ssh through the VS code. ssh zhangj0o@10.68.74.3 PS: the locked screen passwords
